2023-06-24 17:14:30 | Rahul: Yep master players will be cheesing the game for sure 
2023-06-24 17:14:38 | FallingMeteor: of course DSP can get to master, he is playing street since the 90s
2023-06-24 17:14:43 | Sully Fernes: hello
2023-06-24 17:14:55 | ylarllaup: @Gothic Max Online :rainbow: I think aside from DSP most of them are cheating
